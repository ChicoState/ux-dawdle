# Scenarios

Kendra gets home from work: Frustrated from working a job he hates, She winds down with pancakes and energy drinks before sitting at his computer to start making music. Overwhelmed by how complicated it is to figure out how to make music using his software, she gives up on her dreams and moves back home.

Kendra finishes a new song: After turning 27 and finally picking her dream back up, she finishes her first song and wants to share it with the world. She also has a lot of sound bytes from creating her song that she thinks would be interesting to over producers.

Ryan’s students have an idea: Today in class, one of Rachel's students thinks it would be a good idea for the class to get together to record all their instruments separately and make them into one song so each section is of the highest quality.

Thomas’ friend hits a roadblock: Thomas’ friend needs a tool that isn’t offered by his production program. He sits down with Thomas to talk about how they can add the feature. After some discussion, he realizes that his friend needs an effect that sounds like it’s coming from a dank, dripping cave. He creates a new plugin profile, adjusts the reverb appropriately and imports some stock dripping sounds to tie things together. Then he publishes the plugin and his friend, along with anyone else can download it for free at any time.
