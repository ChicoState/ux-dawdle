# DAWdle

The objective of our project is to create a DAWS program that is easily accessible to users of all levels while giving a diverse instrument reservoir and a simple user interface. A DAW is a digital audio workstation used to create, edit, and record music, used mostly by musicians, producers, and audio engineers.
