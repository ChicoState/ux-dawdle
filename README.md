# DAWdle

The objective of our project is to create a DAWS program that is easily accessible to users of all levels while giving a diverse instrument reservoir and a simple user interface. A DAW is a digital audio workstation used to create, edit, and record music, used mostly by musicians, producers, and audio engineers.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Competitive analysis revealed that other Digital Audio Workstation software can be too expensive for the quality of service the customer is receiving; software is either expensive and well crafted or reasonably budgeted and lacking in appearance and functionality.
* Through Heuristic Evaluation of another software, it was observed that these sections were identified as weaknesses:
  * error prevention: complex audio files can contain multiple errors without being detected.
  * user control: **falsely represented key binds**; not every commonly used key bind will work in most DAWs.
  * aesthetic/ minimalistic design: **overwhelming** as a result of cluttered workspace.
* Personas and scenarios are assessments of what users are looking for:
  * An **affordable** way to create music
  * A software that is available on all devices
  * An abundance of instruments
* sketches and diagrams display important features of the program that could be what a user is looking for:
   * a specific instrument not featured on another software
   * simplified user interface **accessible to all proficiencies**
   * software that offers a **broad spectrum of tools** to enhance music

# Phase II: Usability Evaluations

**Executive Summary**

<!--* !!!In a bullet-list, provide a summary that highlights...!!!
* !!!What you've done during this phase...!!!
* !!!and what the significance of it is...!!!
* !!!as an executive would understand.!!!-->
* Cognitive walkthroughs of our software revealed the flaws in our software. By allowing the users to have a set goal and letting them navigate the software as if they were using a competitor's, it gives our UX team feedback directly from the user on how easy it is to use the software.
* Through the cognitive walkthroughs, it was observed that these sections were identified as weaknesses:
  * The inability to create a login to save their work
  * The lack of navigation between creation tools
  * The inability to install and use plugins
  * Users found in unclear how nobs/dials effect sound clips
