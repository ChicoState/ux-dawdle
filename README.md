# DAWdle

The objective of our project is to create a DAWS program that is easily accessible to users of all levels while giving a diverse instrument reservoir and a simple user interface. A DAW is a digital audio workstation used to create, edit, and record music, used mostly by musicians, producers, and audio engineers.

# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

**Executive Summary**

* Competitive analysis revealed that other Digital Audio Workstation software can be too expensive for the quality of service the customer is receiving; software is either expensive and well crafted or reasonably budgeted and lacking in appearance and functionality.
* Through Heuristic Evaluation of another software, it was observed that these sections were identified as weaknesses:
  * error prevention: complex audio files can contain multiple errors without being detected.
  * user control: *falsely represented key binds*; not every commonly used key bind will work in most DAWs.
  * aesthetic/ minimalistic design: overwhelming as a result of cluttered workspace.
* Personas and scenarios are assessments of what users are looking for:
  * An affordable way to create music
  * A software that is available on all devices
  * An abundance of instruments
* sketches and diagrams display important features of the program that could be what a user is looking for:
   * a specific instrument not featured on another software
   * simplified user interface accessible to all proficiencies
   * software that offers a broad spectrum of tools to enhance music
