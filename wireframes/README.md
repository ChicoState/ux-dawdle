# Wireframes
For our wireframe, we took the approach of having a login so that we could verify credentials and possibly save things to the cloud. If you are a new member there is a section to sign up, however, if you are a current member then there is a section for you to re-sign in. If you do not remember your password, you have the option to reset your password. Once logged in, the user is presented with a workstation that provides a list of available tools. These include, creating sound clips, compiling sound clips together to create a song, and adding effects to the sound clips, such as modifying reverb or treble. The intent was that at each stage of creation, you could save your sound clips, songs, and effects so the user can use them however they see fit.
