# Phase I: Analyzing Users, Competitors, and Initial Designs

## Introduction
The objective of our project is to create a DAWS program that is easily accessible to users of all levels while giving a diverse instrument reservoir and a simple user interface. A DAW is a digital audio workstation used to create, edit, and record music, used mostly by musicians, producers, and audio engineers. 

## Methods

<!-- !!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!! -->
### Competitive Analysis
We investigated 5 different products to gain insight about our competitors with the criteria of their strengths, weaknesses, quality level, price/cost, and which platforms they're available on.
- Strengths - What do they do well that stands out against other competitors.
- Weaknesses - what features are they missing that are common.
- Quality level - What is the percetion of the products from the point of view of the customer.
- Price/Cost - how much does the product cost and are there different tier for their product.
- Platorm - what operating systems or devices can the product be used on.

### Heuristic Evaluation
We evaluated out top competitor and did a more thorough investigation into the the features and public perception of the products. In this case, we evaluated FL Studio\
**Visibility of System Status** [10/10]: When you open up a menu to modify something in some way, it pops up with a user interface and visual representation of settings to change.

**Match Between System and the Real World** [10/10]: it relates ideas and concepts to things in the real world, such as terminology of music (base, treble, etc) and displays settings as nob/dials that relate to something you might see on a turntable.

**User Control and Freedom** [6/10]: You’re able to undo your actions using Ctrl+Z but unless you’re someone that is savvy with computers, you might now know that and I was unable to find anything on screen that would represent it. It seems to be very easy to accidentally mess up your GUI interface with no clear way of how to get it back the way it was.

**Consistency and Standard** [10/10?]: I’m not very familiar with what industry standards are when it comes to DAW programs but it looks kind of like any other DAW program that I’ve ever looked at. It used a piano to represent notes which is a common practice, it has dials, nobs, switches, that all relate to real world music production.

**Error Prevention** [4/10]: There’s so much clutter on the screen at all times that it’s hard not to make a mistake when trying to use something. It also drastically increases the learning curve for anyone who’s new to DAW programs to know what anything is going to do the first time they use them.

**Recognition Rather than Recall** [8/10]: Similar to consistency and standards, It uses a lot of visual clues to demonstrate what something does and now to use it. It uses icons for commonly used functions at the top and lets you know whether they’re turned on or off by changing the color.

**Flexibility and Efficiency of Use** [8/10]: Not all of them are hidden from the user but there are some common ones that beginners can use at the top along with other shortcuts for tools that can be found in the tools menu.

**Aesthetic and Minimalist Design** [5/10]: Wasn’t really sure if I should have given this a 10/10 or a 0/10. On one hand, it’s very cluttered with all the tools you can use for production that could be overwhelming for the user but for someone with more experience, it’s all visually represented by real world tools so if you have experience in production, it’s going to be much more clear what’s going on.


### Personas and Scenarios
To gain perspective on who we were trying to provide a product for and what they might want to see in our product, we created Personas and scenarios
- Personas - A fictional person based on the information we have that represents someone who would be interested in our prodect.
- Scenarios - Situations based on a persona where there is a need that we could provide for the user.



## Findings

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
