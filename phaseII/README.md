# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

<!--!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!-->
The objective of phase II is to gather information about the layout of the software by performing cognitive walkthroughs of a set of wireframes. These wireframes are intended to portray to the user what the software might look like when production begins develoopment. With the data from our research, we how to refine the wireframes and prepare a more usable design/layout for when we begin to prototype.

## Methods

During the second phase, our UX team utilized cognitive walkthroughs to analyze the quality of our DAWS, this is important because it allows us the ass the interface from a new user's point of view. The goal is to provide our users with easy-to-use software, and by using our personas and scenarios from our previous phase we were able to create wireframes using some of their needs in mind. The purpose of these wireframes is to reveal the main features of the software and in certain cases depict how the software should be navigated. The cognitive walkthroughs are taken from an external evaluator, someone else who is looking to execute a specific goal, if the goal was met then the wireframes were created properly, however, if they did not meet the intended goal then changes would have to be made.

## Findings

While performing the cognitive walk-throughs, three tests were conducted by external evaluators or people who are not from our team, in doing so these external evaluators can give proper and reliable feedback for our wireframes. The three external evaluators took on the role of some of our personas and tried to execute what that person was trying to do, during the first stages of the wireframes many important key details were missing, however, as the wireframes progressed the needs of the personas were able to be met.

### Cognitive Walkthrough #1
For this cognitive walkthrough I chose to use Thomas. In this scenario Thomas would
like plugins that are not in the application by default.\
Will the user know what to do at this step?\
As the user, I would have no idea where I would go to begin adding or saving anything
created.\
If the user does the right thing, will the user know that they did the right thing and is
making progress toward the goal?\
There is little to no change to show the user the right thing is being done. There doesn’t
seem to be any menus or obvious ways to navigate between pages.

### Cognitive Walkthrough #2
Ryan wants to create music and help others create music as well. He understands that in order to do this, he will need to learn how to make digital music in order to keep up with the younger musicians.\
Ryan likes Rachel’s idea and will try out DAWDLE in his effort to digitally combine a number of solo instrumentals from various students.\
Ryan’s musical experience allows him to see how this app can translate from the physical music board to a digital one.\
While he is not 100% sure of what the grid is for, with some experimentation, he discovers how to add sound clips and make them play in one loop.\
With some finagling, Ryan manages to create a song from all the separate sound clips provided by the students.

### Cognitive Walkthrough #3
Step 1: Thomas opens the application and tries to find the menu bar to create a new
plugin profile, It seems that the menu is nowhere to be seen so Thomas cannot make a
new plugin profile and seems to be lost on whether he is on a new plugin profile or if he
needs to create one to start adjusting the reverb appropriately\
Step 2: Thomas wants to adjust the reverb and knows where to go in the section with all
the knobs but is confused about whether anything happened as no lights or
soundwaves are being displayed.\
Step 3: Thomas imports some stock-dripping sounds by dragging the audio into the
audio trimming section. He knows this section is where his audio must be edited and
knows the audio can be split and such because once it is dragged onto the screen it
displays the audio levels and length\
Step 4: Thomas wants to export his plugin and publish it, however since there is no
menu tab he is confused about what to do next and if he can do anything from here.


## Conclusions
<!--!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!-->
From the cognitive walkthroughs, we evaluted that the biggest issue was the lack of clear navigation between different tools for creating and editing sound clips and songs. There also apears to be a learning curve on how each tools works to produce the desired results. It is also unclear to the user how to add custom plugins that they want to use to help them create music. Finally, the functionality of nobs and dials isn't clear to the user for things such as but not limited to "reverb" and "treble".



## Caveats
<!--!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!-->
During this research cycle, The people who did the cognitive walkthrough didn't necessarily have any experience with DAWs and were asking through the lense of our personas. The wireframes that we had at the time of the cognitive walkthrough were incomplete compared to the ones we're displaying here.
