# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

During the second phase, our UX team utilized cognitive walkthroughs to analyze the quality of our DAWS, this is important because it allows us the ass the interface from a new user's point of view. The goal is to provide our users with easy-to-use software, and by using our personas and scenarios from our previous phase we were able to create wireframes using some of their needs in mind. The purpose of these wireframes is to reveal the main features of the software and in certain cases depict how the software should be navigated. The cognitive walkthroughs are taken from an external evaluator, someone else who is looking to execute a specific goal, if the goal was met then the wireframes were created properly, however, if they did not meet the intended goal then changes would have to be made.

## Findings

While performing the cognitive walk-throughs, three tests were conducted by external evaluators or people who are not from our team, in doing so these external evaluators can give proper and reliable feedback for our fireframes. The three external evaluators took on the role of some of our personas and tried to execute what that person was trying to do, during the first stages of the wireframes many important key details were missing, however, as the wireframes progressed the needs of the personas were able to be met.

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
