# Phase II: Refining interaction and designing wireframes

## Introduction

!!! Describe the general problem that the project is trying to solve and the focus of this interval of work !!!

## Methods

During the second phase, our UX team utilized cognitive walkthroughs to analyze the quality of our DAWS. The goal is to provide our users with an easy to use software, and by using our personas and scenarios from our previous phase we were able to create wireframes using some of their needs in mind. The cognitive walkthroughs are taken from an external evaluator, someone else who is looking for a specitify goal and is trying to execute that goal using our wireframes, if the goal was met then the wire frames were useful however if they did not meet the intended goal then changes would have to be made.


!!! Describe research methods you used to discover new insights, which explains the purpose of each. Provide enough detail that someone would be able to faithfully reproduce your research. !!!

## Findings
Findings:
What data was provided for that research method?
External evaluators going through the wire frames and trying to use the software
So far with what we have the users are confused as to what they are looking at how the user interface should be used
summarize the result to each datum

!!! For each research method, detail each of the findings point-by-point to clarify new discoveries of users' needs !!!

## Conclusions

!!! Discoveries derived from the methods and their findings. Interpret how the findings translate into new insights into UX design recommendations. Describe those recommendations and how they should shape future work. In this section, include the new design recommendations based on the latest user insights. !!!

## Caveats

!!! Considerations and/or limitations to the methods you chose and the findings/conclusions drawn from them. In other words, give warnings if there are limitations to your research such as not being able to find enough users of a particular demographic, the methods not being able to expose certain information, assumptions you made, etc. !!!
